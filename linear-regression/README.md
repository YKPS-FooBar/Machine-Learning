# Linear Regression

Since George Yu did not elaborate enough here, I will continue the work of documenting for him. He might have illuminated some guidelines on this project in the past, but I was not present.

Implement a linear regression in a high-level programming language, i.e., `{ x | x ∈ Programming Languages ∧ x ≠ Java }`. Try to use the least number of imported packages.
